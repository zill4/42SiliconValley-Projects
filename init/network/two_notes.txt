2. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
	(a) Identify broadcast address
	(b) Identify all IP addresses which are part of the same subnet

what is a subnet?
	A segment of a larger IP network that is used to subdivide large networks
	into smaller more effcient ones.

IP addresses are divided into two fields:
	(a) Network Prefix
	(b) Host ID
	Ex - Net Pre.Net Pre.Subnet ID.Host ID
				172.16.2.15
				N.N.S.H
	Given network interface machines
	Ex - en0 after running ifconfig
	target inet: which is the IP address in the address family of the machine en0.
	ifconfig <target machine> | grep <address_family> | cut -d "delimeter" -f <field number>
	ifconfig	en0	| grep "inet" |	cut -d " "	-f 2
