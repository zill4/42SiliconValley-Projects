42_Projects is a collection of the work school work done at 42 Silicon Valley. Everytime I work on a new project,
I will upload my progress here first, before submitting to the local repository at 42.

## Libft
  Libft is a library of approximately 54 functions written for the 42 curriculum. Most of the functions are 
  functions that would be included in the "String" or "stdio" library files. The purpose of rewriting these functions
  was for building a basic understanding of core programming concepts.
  
## Get_Next_Line
  Get_Next_Line is a c function that was written for the purpose reading from any given io stream, that is delimenated by 
  '\n' newline characters. Upon reaching a new line, the function keeps it position in static memory such that the consecutive    line can be read upon the next function call.
## Fillit
  Fillit is a type of tetris program written to recieve a set number of blocks in a 4x4 format up to 26 of them. 
  for example, ..#.  is a block. Given this, and many more blocks, Fillit places all blocks in the smallest possible
               .##.  generated space.
               .#..
